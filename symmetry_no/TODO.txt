Virtual instance in differential self-consistency loss:

generate on the spot
--> requires specification in config file(?)

A virtual instance is defined by a bunch of parameters:
  'length': <length scale of coefficient field>
  'length_g': <length scale of the bounary condition>
  'size': number of grid points in each direction

There are more fine-grained settings that could be made, but we can leave it at this for now.
