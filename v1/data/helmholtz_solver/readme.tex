 afun betafun ffun gfun vfun: coefficients a, beta, f, g, v respectively, defined on the whole domain (so of course beta and g vanishes except when on the boundary)\
\
elementstiff2.m: assembling the stiffness matrix\
\
FEM.m: FEM solution.\
\
The code is tailored to Robin boundary conditions. To run, just input FEM(N_f,k0) with the desired mesh size and wave number.

The code here is the one with Mie resonances. See also the zip file for the high wavenumber example. For other examples, change simply change the configurations of the coefficients afun betafun ffun gfun vfun.
